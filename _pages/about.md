I am currently an undergraduate student at [Yingcai Honors College](https://www.yingcai.uestc.edu.cn/en/index.htm), [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/), majoring in Computer Science and Technology. I have been mentored by [Prof. Liang-Jian Deng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=TZs9NxkAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate), with co-mentors including [Prof. Minyu Feng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=60rlZmAAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [Prof. Xiaojie Chen](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xiaojie-Chen-14). Presently, I am working under the supervision of [Prof. Qi Su](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pV8jsDsAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, focusing on research related to evolutionary dynamics.

My research interests primarily lie in network evolutionary game theory and its interdisciplinary applications with computer science. I aim to build a strong theoretical foundation while exploring the practical potential of evolutionary game theory.

Welcome like-minded friends to contact me at any time via [email](mailto:lxinuestc@gmail.com) for potential collaboration.
